## 🔧 Backtesting Engine Architecture

This application implements a professional event-driven backtesting framework to ensure that there is no lookahead bias and that the simulation is as realistic as possible.

-   **Data Handler**: Manages historical price data retrieval and provides market data bars to the system.
-   **Strategy**: Generates trading signals based on technical indicators and market conditions.
-   **Portfolio**: Tracks positions, cash, and total equity. It handles risk management and order sizing.
-   **Execution Handler**: Simulates order execution and the associated costs (slippage and commission can be added).
-   **Event Queue**: A central message bus that coordinates the flow of `MARKET`, `SIGNAL`, `ORDER`, and `FILL` events between components.
